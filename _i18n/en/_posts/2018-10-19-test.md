It's 8:30 am in the morning. 

An alarm rang. 

I reached out to my phone to turn it off. 

Before my feet even hit the ground, I discovered that there were 2 new notifications on my Facebook app. One was about a new post in some online market that I didn't even remember following. Another was from a stranger who liked my silly selfie. "Great, someone liked it".

While scrolling through my Facebook feeds, I noticed a dozen of videos that kept playing automatically. I watched one video about a funny dog getting trolled by his owner. That was hillarious. 

Then the next video showed up which also looked interesting. I tapped on it and continue watching.

45 minutes passed, I got out of bed, got ready and headed to the office at 9:30 am. 

It was a productive day. I got back home and had dinner. It's 9:00 pm already.

I sat on a sofa browsing through Facebook. Someone shared an article about a political injustice that seemed serious. I didn't tap on it. I acknowledged the article from its title and assumed the rest of the story. 

I continued to scroll until I started to see my old feeds from yesterday. Okay, I guess I'm already up-to-date with the world. "Facebook is so boring these days".

I opened Youtube. There were about 20 new videos in my recommendation list. "Interesting". I watched a few of them and followed some more channels.  

At 11:30 pm, I brushed my teeth, lied down comfortably in bed and watched some more videos until my eyes force themselves to close. 

"It was a good day".

The next morning, I was woken up by the alarm, reached out to my phone and repeated the routine all over again. This continued for months.

## What's wrong?

Actually, there's nothing wrong with that. It all depends on priorities. 

If you decide to only focus on 2 things: work and family, then after a long day at work, after your family has been taken care of, there's nothing wrong with watching a bunch of videos or browsing Facebook mindlessly. It's your free time after all, you need to relax and be entertained.

The problem comes when you start compromising your main priorities to make time for Facebook, Instagram or Youtube. For examples:
* You try to find idle time at work to check your social content. You easily get distracted by notifications and couldn't concentrate for long hours. You constantly check your phone during meetings and have no idea what other people are discussing about.
* While having dinner with your family, you stare at your phone most of the time instead of listening or thinking about what to say.

I'm sure you may have seen this quite often nowadays. It's prevalent to the point where you may think that this behaviour is totally acceptable. Who doesn't do that, right?

No, it's not fine at all. 

However, I consider this case to be an easy problem. It's easy to notice and easy to make adjustment. If you get too distracted at work, your boss will tell you. If you don't pay attention to your family, they will tell you. There's no way you won't notice your social addiction. 

## So what is the difficult problem?

A more serious issue is that because of this addiction, you don't even bother finding a quiet time to reflect on yourselves, to see whether you're improving everyday and whether you're on track of achiving your goals. 

If you aim to reach the top of your career, would it be enough to only spend the minimal time at work and then call it a day? Is there anything else that you can contribute? Do you need to learn something else?

Since you have to sit for long hours at the office, how long can you sustain if you don't fix your posture? When was the last time you did exercises? Are you gonna be healthy enough to pursue your dream?

Do you have a retirement plan? What age do you want to retire at? Is it 30, 40, 50 or 60? How to get there?	What do you want to do after you retire?

Are those questions important to you? What do you want to do with your life? When is the time to sit back and think if your eyes are constantly checking up photos and watching random videos on the internet?

This problem is difficult because: 
* You may not know that it exists at all. Nobody's gonna tell you that you need to work on your long-term goals besides work and family. Getting lost in the internet has become the norm as long as you don't slack off at work and don't let your family down.
* It's hard to resist the instant gratification of opening that little blue app compared to sitting down and working on your goals without any noticeable results for the next 6-12 months. Hence, it requires a good planning skill and discipline which are extremely hard to achieve in this high-demanding world.
