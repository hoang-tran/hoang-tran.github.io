Hi, my name is Hoang Tran.

I’m a guy who loves to make great software. I write weekly about iOS development, testing and deployment.

When I’m not programming, I usually find myself traveling to somewhere new with my wife.

I have a small dream of leaving a mark to this world someday. I hope I’m still alive when that happens :)
